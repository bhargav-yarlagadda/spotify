## Issues

Alright, so here‚Äôs the situation: I might not be a coding genius, but there‚Äôs a little snag when it comes to extracting audio. I need to have **FFmpeg** downloaded to make this work. The funny part? I don‚Äôt have it, and I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt either‚Äîunless you‚Äôve got some secret tech stash I don‚Äôt know about!

When you try to download your favorite jam, it throws an error like it‚Äôs trying to tell you, ‚ÄúNope, not today!‚Äù But don‚Äôt sweat it! Just keep enjoying your music and giving those songs some love. Who needs audio extraction when you can vibe out like there‚Äôs no tomorrow? üé∂

So, keep listening and keep liking‚Äîbecause life‚Äôs too short for anything less than awesome tunes!

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
